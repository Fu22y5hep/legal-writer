The Legal Writer project is an AI-powered web application designed to assist legal practitioners in drafting and managing legal documents such as heads of argument, legal articles, client summaries, and theses. Built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, the platform offers a user-friendly dashboard where users can create and oversee cases or projects, interact with AI for writing assistance and legal research via chat functionalities, and organize documents like authorities, application papers, and pleadings. With responsive design components and specific routes for cases and chats, the app aims to streamline the legal writing process and enhance productivity for legal professionals.
